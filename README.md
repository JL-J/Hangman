# Hangman

A program created using C# and .NET framwork that lets a user play hangman by guessing letters in a word.

## Getting started
Assuming you're using Visual Studio, press F5 to launch the program. Press any button on the form to guess that letter. 
If the letter is present in the word you will see the diplay text change. 
Be careful as you only have 10 guesses before you lose the game!

## Further development
- Currently the word the user is guessing is hard coded. This would need changing so that a random word is selected at the start of each new game for continued play value.
- Create a reset button.
- Create a display so that the user can see if they have already guessed that letter in a previous turn.
